# Screenshot Placeholders

These text files are placeholders for actual screenshots that should be created from the running application. To generate these screenshots:

1. Start the AWS to OCI Policy Translator application
2. Navigate to each page represented by these text files
3. Take a screenshot of the application
4. Save the screenshot as a PNG file with the same base name (e.g., convert "main_menu.txt" to "main_menu.png")
5. Replace the reference to placeholder screenshots in the README.md by removing the note at the bottom of the Screenshots section

## Required Screenshots

- main_menu.png - The main navigation bar
- simple_policy.png - The simple policy translation interface
- compute_policy.png - The compute policy translation interface
- object_storage_policy.png - The object storage policy translation interface
- aws_policy_generator.png - The AWS policy generator interface
- oci_reference.png - The OCI reference policies documentation
- service_mappings.png - The service mappings table
- policy_templates.png - The OCI policy templates interface

Once all screenshots are created, they will be automatically displayed in the README.md documentation.
